          support services listed on our website. InnovaCARE Tech matches
          Listeners (as hereafter defined) with you based on the information
          provided by you and by them. These Listeners are only suggestions, and
          InnovaCARE Tech does not recommend any particular Listener or
          guarantee their ability to meet your needs. You are responsible for
          the conduct of any session with a Listener. InnovaCARE Tech is not
          liable or responsible for any harm that arises out of or relates to a
          session you participate in. If you have a complaint against a
          Listener, you can email us at support@Innovacaretech.com and identify
          the relevant Listener. We will make best efforts to direct you to the
          applicable regulatory authority to assist you in filing your
          complaint. On the Platform, maintaining respectful and appropriate
          interactions is paramount; any form of sexual or intimate behavior is
          strictly prohibited, before, during or after sessions, and should be
          reported immediately for review and appropriate action. The duration
          of a session shall be presented to you at the time of booking. In
          scheduling your sessions, you must also comply with our termination
          policy set out in Section 7 of these Terms of Use, as such policy may
          be amended by us from time to time. You may end your relationship with
          a Listener at any time, subject to our termination policy. You agree
          that you may interact with your Listener through the Platform only.

          through the Platform, and any in-person meetings or communication
          outside the platform are strictly forbidden. If a user expresses a
          desire to connect outside the platform, the Listener is obligated to
          inform InnovaCARE Tech immediately. This ensures a safe environment
          for all parties and you agree that InnovaCARE Tech holds no liability
          for any unauthorized interactions. A Listener is obligated to inform
          us if you wish to visit them in person or through other means. You
          expressly acknowledge and consent to the disclosure by the Listener to
          us of such information. InnovaCARE Tech does not mandate any specific
          methods or styles of conversation and support, nor do we recommend any
          particular approach over another. Such decisions are made solely by
          you and your Listener. If you and your Listener decide to engage in
          group conversations or shared support sessions, you agree that
          information discussed during such sessions is confidential and shall
          not be utilized in any legal proceedings. You agree not to involve any

          that confirm their background or qualifications (e.g., certificates,
          training documentation). This may include criminal record checks and
          other background verification processes. The Listener may be asked to
          upload copies of these documents for verification purposes. Once the
          verification process is complete, a special badge is added to the

        Use and Disclosure of Personal Information By accessing and using the Platform to receive Services via the use of online communication tools such as secure text, voice and video, you consent to be connected with one or more Listeners or Support Staff. Listeners provide empathetic, professional, confidential support, and aim to foster meaningful conversations. They may ask you questions about your thoughts, feelings, and experiences to better understand your needs and provide support. Support Staff offer services that are informational in nature.  <br />
        Neither the Services provided by Listeners nor the Support Services provided by Support Staff are intended to replace your primary care relationship with your family physician, counsellor, therapist, psychiatrist or other primary care health professional. You should continue to consult your family physician or other primary care health professional, counsellor, therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist regularly or as needed or recommended by them. Listeners will make every effort to keep your personal information private. If you wish to have information released, you will be required to sign a consent form before such information is released. There are some limitations to confidentiality to which you need to be aware. Your Listener may consult with a supervisor or other professional Listener in order to give you the best possible service. In the event that a Listener consults with another Listener, no identifying information such as name would be released. Listeners are required by law to release information when the client poses a risk to themselves or others and in cases of abuse to children or the elderly. If the Listener receives a court order or subpoena, the Listener may be required to release some information. In such a case, the Listener will consult with other professionals and limit the release to only what is necessary by law. You are encouraged to ask questions of the Listeners regarding any part of the session that is conducted or recommended to you, all of which should be answered to your satisfaction. If you are not satisfied with the explanation or information provided by the Listeners regarding any session that is conducted or recommended for you, you should not continue it or you should seek a second opinion from a health professional that is not affiliated with InnovaCARE Tech. You have the right to refuse or withdraw consent at any time. In addition to the material risks that may be associated with a Listening session, there are potential material risks that are specifically associated with using online communication tools and which may adversely impact the ability of the Listeners and Support Staff to provide Services, including but not limited to (a) poor quality audio-video connections due to remote locations or other network limitations that may limit the ability of the Listeners to appropriately conduct the session or otherwise obtain sufficient personal information from you to properly conduct the session, and (b) unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of your personal information due to a security protocol breach or failure. <br />

          InnovaCARE Tech may, in its sole discretion, offer some of the Services to you for free or charge fees in accordance with its fee schedule or the fee schedules as determined by the Listeners and is subject to change, from time to time (the "Fee Schedule"). You or a responsible third party will pay any such applicable fees in accordance with the Fee Schedule (the "Fees"). Unless otherwise expressly indicated in the Fee Schedule, all Fees are quoted in Canadian dollars exclusive of applicable sales and value added taxes and are non-refundable and payable upon invoicing or demand from InnovaCARE Tech. You or a responsible third party will pay all sales and value added taxes that may be imposed in each applicable jurisdiction and will hold and save InnovaCARE Tech harmless in respect of any such taxes. If a third party (e.g., such as an employer or supplemental health insurance provider) has arranged with InnovaCARE Tech to pay the fee or any portion of the fee, or if the fee is pursuant to some other arrangement with InnovaCARE Tech, that fee adjustment will be reflected in the fee that you are ultimately charged. If you have a Health Spending Account ("HSA") offered as a benefit by your employer, you agree to pay all fees or charges to your HSA Account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. Please check with your employer to determine if any Services will be reimbursed. InnovaCARE Tech reserves the right to modify or implement a new pricing structure at any time prior to billing you or a responsible third party for your initial payment or for future payments due pursuant to these Terms of Use.

You hereby authorize InnovaCARE Tech to charge any and all Fees that become due and payable to the Payment Method. You agree to pay such fees, charges and penalties (including costs and expenses related to collection by InnovaCARE Tech of overdue payments) as InnovaCARE Tech may from time to time set out on the Platform in respect of late or overdue payments, or declined or unsuccessful Payment Method transactions. In engaging our Services you may be sent text message(s), e-mails and/or push notifications which provide you with important and useful information regarding our Services.

InnovaCARE Tech does not charge you for this correspondence. Your mobile telephone network provider may impose message, standard wireless and/or data charges or charge limitations which are beyond our control and for which you will be solely responsible. By engaging our Services, including registering for a User Account, you agree to receive emails and push notifications relating to our Services. If you consent during registration, you also agree to receive text messages. You warrant that you are the owner of the mobile telephone to which you have requested the SMS message(s), e-mails and push notifications should be sent to and that you have full authority to authorize such charges and will be solely responsible for charges, if any, to be incurred by the relevant mobile telephone network provider. We are not liable for any delays or failures in your receipt of any SMS message(s), e-mails or push notifications as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your mobile telephone network provider and processing by your mobile telephone device.
